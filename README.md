# angular-window

Move window events to angular.

## Install

You can install this package with `bower`.

### bower

```shell
bower install angular-window
```

Add a `<script>` to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular-window/window.js"></script>
```

Then add `ngWindow` as a dependency for your app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngWindow']);
```

## Documentation

Add to dependencies:

```javascript
angular.controller('myController', ['$scope', 'ngWindow', function($scope, ngWindow) {
  ...
}]);
```

bind and unbind on change event:

```javascript
var onChange = function(width, height) {
  var i = 10;
  $scope.value = width + i * height;
};
ngWindow.bind(onChange);
...
ngWindow.unbind(onChange);
```

or through Angular event:

```javascript
$scope.$on('$windowResized', function(data) {
  $scope.value = data.width + data.height;
});
```

use directly through $rootScope:

```html
<div ng-style="{'width': $root.size.width / 2}">...</div>
```
